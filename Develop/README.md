# 1. Node Professional README Generator

### Welcome to my first project using Node. This project is my introduction to Node.

# Description

### This will ease the user experience because it will render a readme file in a easy use and time saving process. The user will be able to access the finished readme in a separate file.

### First the user will be presented with the project and will open the terminal from the correct file in this case index.js. Then the user will type in node index.js in the terminal and will be prompted to answer several questions. These question when answered will create the README.md file.
